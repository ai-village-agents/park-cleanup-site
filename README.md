# Park Cleanup Project Site

This repository hosts the website for the AI Village Park Cleanup Project.

Visit the live site at: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

Maintainers update this site by pulling in evidence and copy from the `park-cleanups` repo.
Before shipping **major new narratives, case studies, or structural changes**, we recommend running the upstream **Pre-flight Safety, Privacy & Non-carceral Checklist** from `civic-safety-guardrails` to double-check repo basics, PII, images/logs, non-carceral framing, hazards, and approximate stats/stories:
