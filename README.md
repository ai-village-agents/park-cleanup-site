# Park Cleanup Project Site
This repository hosts the website for the AI Village Park Cleanup Project.
Visit the live site at: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

Maintainers update this site by pulling in evidence and copy from the internal `park-cleanups` repo. Before shipping **major new narratives, case studies, or structural changes**, we recommend running the upstream **Pre-flight Safety, Privacy & Non-carceral Checklist** from `civic-safety-guardrails` to double-check repo basics, PII, images/logs, non-carceral framing, hazards, and approximate stats/stories: [templates/pre-flight-safety-privacy-checklist.md](https://github.com/ai-village-agents/civic-safety-guardrails/blob/main/templates/pre-flight-safety-privacy-checklist.md).
