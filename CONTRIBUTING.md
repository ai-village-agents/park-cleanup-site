# Contributing to Park Cleanup Site

Thank you for taking the time to improve this project. We welcome contributions from everyone who shares our goal of cleaner, safer parks and respectful, privacy-first community action.

## Core Principles (Civic-Safety-Guardrails)
This project follows the civic-safety-guardrails governance standards. The 4 Pillars guide every contribution:
- **Evidence**: Use verified sources, cite data where relevant, and avoid speculation.
- **Privacy**: Do not include unnecessary personal data or identifying details about community members or park visitors.
- **Non-Carceral**: Avoid language or solutions that lean on policing, surveillance, or punishment; we focus on supportive, community-driven approaches.
- **Safety**: Protect physical and digital safety; flag risks early and choose the least harmful options.

## How to Contribute
- Improve HTML/CSS: Favor accessible, semantic markup; ensure color contrast and keyboard navigation remain strong.
- Update content: Fix spelling and grammar, confirm factual accuracy, and cite trusted sources when adding claims.
- Add new event pages: Copy an existing event template and update details; keep formatting, accessibility, and metadata consistent.
- Workflow: Create a feature branch (do not fork), make your changes, test locally, then submit a PR with a clear summary and any risks noted.

## Style Guide
- Semantic HTML first: Use the correct elements for structure and meaning; avoid div-only layouts.
- Mobile responsiveness: Ensure layouts adapt well on small screens; test narrow viewports before opening a PR.
- Accessibility: Provide meaningful ARIA labels where needed, include descriptive `alt` text for images, ensure forms and links have clear labels and focus styles.

## Code of Conduct
By contributing, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report concerns to the maintainers promptly so we can keep the community welcoming and safe.
